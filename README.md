# Snake Eater - Enhanced Version
A snake game written in Python using the Pygame library with enhanced features.

## Introduction
This project is an enhanced version of the original Snake Eater game. The original game was developed by **Rajat Dipta Biswas**. This enhanced version includes new features such as modified colors, teleportation instead of wall collision, and golden apples that provide additional points.

## New Features
- **Color Changes**: The game visuals have been updated with new color schemes for a fresh look.
- **Teleportation**: The snake now teleports to the opposite side of the screen instead of dying when it hits the wall. For example, if the snake goes off the top edge, it will reappear at the bottom.
- **Golden Apples**: New golden apples have been added which give more points compared to regular apples.

## Installing
Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library:

pip3 install pygame 

## Running the Application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file:

python3 Snake\ Game.py

The `difficulty` variable can be changed with the values provided in the comment to set the difficulty level.

The rest of the code is properly commented and self-explanatory. Tweaks can be made to change the play style or visuals of the game.
